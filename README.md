### Notes to developers
  - If not already installed then install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Install project dependencies to project root
  - initialize a Node project: `npm init -yes`
  - Install Popper.js: `npm install popper.js`
  - Install jQuery: `npm install jquery`
  - Install Bootstrap: `npm install bootstrap`
  - If not already installed then install Dart Sass: `npm install -g sass`

You should now have a folder called node_modules and within should be the folders Bootstrap, jQuery & Popper.js, you will also have a file called package.json and package-lock.json

### Compile SCSS (http://sass-lang.com/)
  - Compile once: `sass scss:css`
  - Compile on every change: `sass --watch scss:css`
