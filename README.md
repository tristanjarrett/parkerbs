1. Install project dependencies to project root
  - If not already installed then install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - Initiate a Node project: "npm init -yes"
  - Install Popper.js: "npm install popper.js"
  - Install jQuery: "npm install jquery"
  - Install Bootstrap: "npm install bootstrap"
  - If not already installed then install Dart Sass: "npm install -g sass"

You should now have a folder called node_modules and within should be the folders Bootstrap, jQuery & Popper.js
You will also have a file called package.json and package-lock.json

2. Compile SCSS (http://sass-lang.com/)
  - Compile once: "sass scss:css"
  - Compile on every change: "sass --watch scss:css"
